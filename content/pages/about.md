Outside of my research and study, I co-founded a startup (\younico) that had the aim of enhancing entrepreneurial activity at universities and I am committed to helping social innovative projects. To achieve the latter, I am currently part of Young Innovators, an honours programme that focuses on social innovative entrepreneurship, and I volunteer at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.volteuropa.org/">Volt</a>, the first pan-european political movement.
