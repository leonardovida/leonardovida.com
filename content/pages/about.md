Graduating student with honours and cum-laude of the M.Sc. in Applied Data Science at the faculty of Information and Computing Sciences at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a> (The Netherlands). Currently working as Data Engineer (previously as Data Analyst) for the research department of Utrecht University. Here I developed a data pipeline to ingest exam-related data using Spark and Airflow. The data pipeline creates a data lake, a data warehouse and also has an anlytics module.

Before starting this M.Sc. I graduated with a degree in Economics from the faculty of Business and Economics at Maastricht University (The Netherlands) and I worked as Business Analyst at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.valuepartners.com/en/">Value Partners</a>, a strategic management consulting firm based in Milan.

Outside of my research and study, I co-founded a startup (\younico) that had the aim of enhancing entrepreneurial activity at universities and I am committed to helping social innovative projects. To achieve the latter, I am currently part of Young Innovators, an honours programme that focuses on social innovative entrepreneurship, and I volunteer at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.volteuropa.org/">Volt</a>, the first pan-european political movement.

The languages I am most fluent in: Python, R, SQL.

Tools that I often use: Spark, PyTorch - Keras - scikit, GCP, Airflow & dbt.
